### Project Introduction:

Create a command line application that will allow employees to enter their name, time worked, task worked on, and general notes about the task into a database. There should be a way to add a new entry, list all entries for a particular employee, and list all entries that match a date or search term. Print a report of this information to the screen, including the date, title of task, time spent, employee, and general notes.
